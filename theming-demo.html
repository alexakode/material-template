    <h1>CSS Theming Demo</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This card demonstrates the current theme colors from your CSS files. The
        colours are imported as CSS files from Figma, using the
        <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder"
          >Material Theme builder</a
        >. The naming conventions should allow drop-in replacements. While the
        Material system uses the HCT colour space, CSS (and Figma) does not
        support that directly, so the colours have been converted in the export.
        The CSS variables are prefixed with <code>--md-sys-color-</code> to
        avoid conflicts with other styles. Other documentation exists with more
        extensive descriptions of the colour system and other usage guidelines.
        This demo is intended to showcase the basic usage of these colors in a
        simple environment using rudimentary conditionals based on the user's
        preferences of colour mode and contrast.
      </p>

    <p>
      For the sake of this demo, the actual CSS styling for the file is in
      demo.css,
      <s
        >attached to an external colour scheme css file, and a bit of javascript
        is used to select which css file to use.</s
      >
      Edit: after implementing the newer css functions, the javascript is no
      longer needed. Light and dark themes are now handled by the browser's
      native support for colour schemes, and high contrast mode is handled by
      the browser's native support for high contrast mode. The CSS variables are
      used to apply the correct colours based on the user's preferences.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      Try switching your system's colour scheme or enabling high contrast mode
      to see the theme change!
